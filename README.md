# Overview

The goal of Mango Markets is to create a trader and maker friendly decentralized trading platform. Initial core features will be fully on-chain margin trading on limit order books as well as perpetual futures, which are the main drivers of centralized exchange revenue. Moving those to DeFi is an essential step for money legos to overcome the CeFi platforms.

Building on Ethereum would hinder us from implementing the best possible user experience, so we built on Solana instead. We are following other influential players in the field with their choice of platform here and are excited to pioneer the Solana ecosystem together with everyone that is already building on it.
