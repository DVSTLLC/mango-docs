# Swap

**Why aren't my swapped assets showing  in my Account Balances?**

Assets are swapped into your connected wallet, not MangoAccount



**Why do my swap balances not match my Account balances?**

Swaps occur in connected wallet and separate from your MangoAccount. The swap balances are reflective of your wallet balances.&#x20;



**What exchange does the swap use?**&#x20;

Swap feature is an integration of Jupiter Aggregator. Jupiter checks for the best prices and routes across all Solana dApps to give you the best price \
