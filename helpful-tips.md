# Helpful Tips

Mango is a powerful platform, some things to know to get the most out of it. \
\
Collateral is shared between borrow/lending and leverage trading. If you deposit into your MangoAccount, those assets will automatically earn interest and serve as available collateral to leverage trade or withdraw a borrow.&#x20;

Funds are automatically borrowed for leverage trading. If you would like to place a leverage trade, simply place an order for your desired amount and if the required capital is beyond your deposits, funds will be borrowed for the position (as long as account health is eligible). \
\
To avoid taking on a borrow or leverage position to swap in spot markets, you can uncheck the margin box in the trade form to ensure no borrows will be taken.&#x20;
