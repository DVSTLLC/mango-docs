# Liquidator

The reference liquidator will be open sourced as soon as we reach sufficient decentralisation in the testing phase. We are actively supporting developers interested in implementing their own. Reach out to us on [discord](https://discord.gg/cbDHKCnGJU) in case you have questions on how to get started.
