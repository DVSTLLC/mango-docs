Mango Markets offers an approachable, powerful platform. Trade up to 5x leverage, long or short, with limit or market orders. Mango users save substantially on Serum DEX trading fees**,** more info _here_. 

Read below to learn how to trade using Mango Markets step-by-step, from connecting your wallet to making a trade.

## **Connect to Mango Markets and Deposit Funds**

First, connect your sollet.io wallet by selecting ‘Connect wallet’ in the top right of the Trade view.

* For help creating or funding a Sollet.io wallet, please see _here_

Next, confirm the connection in sollet.io pop-up window.

We are working closely with Sollet.io to utilize auto approval of transactions, however this feature is not yet functional and all transactions including deposits, trades, settlements, and withdrawals must be approved manually. 

On Mango, although your wallet is connected, funds must be deposited into your Margin Account to be accessed on the platform. Click ‘Deposit’ to add BTC, ETC, or USDT to your Margin Account.

In the deposit window, first choose your desired asset, then ensure a wallet address is selected in the drop down and enter the amount you wish to move into your Margin account. You’ll need a little SOL in your wallet to cover the transaction fees. All deposits on Mango earn interest; rates can be found in green next to the assets.

## **How to Make a Trade**

To trade, select your desired asset pair in the top left drop-down menu. 

![](../.gitbook/assets/markets.png)

Choose between Buy or Sell and provide trade details: size, price, and order type. To place an order, click the big Buy or Sell asset button at the bottom of the trading box. Note the options of POST and IOC. When IOC \(Immediate or Cancel\) is selected, if an order is placed and not filled within seconds, it's cancelled. When POST is selected, limit orders are added to the order-book and earn maker fees if filled. POST orders will always be the 'maker'.

 Limit orders open an order at a set price. If the price of an asset in the orderbook reaches that price, the order will get filled. Market orders will buy or sell the asset immediately at the next price in the orderbook.

If a taker order is filled, assets will appear in the deposits of your margin account.

If a maker order is filled, funds must be settled before appearing in your deposits. Visit the 'Balances' tab and click 'Settle'. Only assets included in the selected trading pair will appear here.

Visit ‘Open Orders’ to view and cancel your open orders at any time.

## **How to Trade with Leverage**

To make a leveraged trade, place an order with size greater than your deposit value; funds are automatically borrowed and appear in the ‘Borrows’ section of your Margin Account. Interest is accumulated and deducted continuously. Rates are on an annual basis and can be found in red next to the asset. The maximum leverage allowance is 5x. 

![](../.gitbook/assets/borrows.png)

To open a leverage position, an Initial Collateral Ratio of 120% must be met. Collateral Ratio is the value of the user's deposits and positions divided by the value of their loans. 

![](../.gitbook/assets/collateral.png)

Once a position is opened, it must maintain a Maintenance Collateral Ratio above 110%. If an account falls below 110% it will be liquidated and funds lost. To increase collateral ratio, reduce borrows or deposit funds into your margin account.   
  
Current collateral ratio is displayed beneath your Margin Account. 

![](../.gitbook/assets/collat_percentage.png)

To close a leveraged position, you must settle your borrows. To do this, your deposits must equal or surpass borrows for an asset. To increase deposits, trade for or deposit the asset. Once deposit requirements are met, click ‘Settle Borrows’ and your loans will be repaid.

## **How to Withdraw Funds**

Funds can be withdrawn at any time; simply click ‘Withdraw’ in your Margin Account. 

![](../.gitbook/assets/withdrawl.png)

In the Withdraw window, choose your desired asset and select the corresponding wallet address from the drop down. If the message ‘No wallet address found for \[asset\]’ appears, please make sure the token is added to your Sollet.io.

## **How to view Fee Discounts, Contribute SRM** 

Mango traders save substantially on Serum DEX trading fees. Serum's tier structure determines fee rates based on the amount of SRM held in an account; the more SRM in an account, the less you pay in fees and the more you earn as a maker. The highest tier is 1 MegaSerum\(MSRM\), worth 1 million SRM, and unrealistic for most people to obtain. Luckily, Mango margin accounts are structured such that SRM deposits are combined with all users to collectively reach a higher tier and benefit together when trading on the platform. SRM deposits are exempt from liquidation and not counted toward margin collateral. Visit 'Fee Discounts'  to view current fee tier and  contribute or withdraw SRM.
