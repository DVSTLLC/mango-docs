# How to Receive devnet Tokens

## How to receive USDC on devnet? 

It can be helpful to test on Devnet when integrating into the platform for trading, market making, or running liquidations without risking valuable tokens. 

First, connect your sollet.io wallet to the devnet network. Sollet.io \(NOT browser extension\) is the only functional devnet wallet at this time. 

Network can be toggled in the top right of the wallet.

Enter Faucet address: **B87AhxX6BkBsj3hnyHzcerX2WxPoACC7ZyDr8E7H9geN** 

 Enter the amount of USDC you wish to receive in 'Amount'. There is 9 decimals on the mint, so an amount of 1000000000 will return 1.0 USDC in your wallet
