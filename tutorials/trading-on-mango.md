_Mango users save substantially on Serum DEX trading fees_; [Serum](https://projectserum.com) powers mangos spot margined markets. SRM deposits are pooled together to give every Mango user the ability to save substantially on taker fees. There is more info below under [Fee Discounts](getting-started.md#how-to-view-fee-discounts-contribute-srm).

## Placing a Trade on ðŸ¥­ 

To place an order, first decide whether you want to Buy or Sell an asset. 

Note when doing limit orders, the options of POST and IOC. 

* When IOC (Immediate or Cancel) is selected - if an order is placed and not filled within seconds, it's canceled. 
* When POST is selected, limit orders are added to the order book and earn maker fees if filled. 
* POST orders will always be the 'maker'.

Limit orders open an order at a set price. If the price action of an asset in the order-book reaches that price, the order will get filled.

Market orders hit the book immediately on the bid or ask side depending on if you bought or sold, the position then fills at an average price of the orders taken.

Spot margined positions can be viewed under your accounts tab within your portfolio view under "Balances", Perpetual positions can be viewed.

**For Spot margined markets** to make a leveraged trade, place an order with a size greater than your deposit value; funds are automatically borrowed or utilize the leverage slider to decide your risk or don't worry about margin or leverage at all and treat it as a spot market; Simply exchange for the even value of another asset.

**For perpetual futures markets** to make a leveraged trade is very similar, except your are not buying the asset in question, you are simply buying exposure to that asset and its price movements, positions can be view under the perp positions tab under or under accounts tab.

## ðŸ¥­ **pays the Lowest Fees **

Mango traders save substantially on Serum DEX trading fees by pooling SRM together in Mango. Serum's tier structure determines fee rates based on the amount of SRM held in an account; the more SRM in an account, the less you pay in fees and the more you earn as a maker. The highest tier is 1 MegaSerum(MSRM), worth 1 million SRM, and unrealistic for most people to obtain. 

Luckily, Mango margin accounts are structured such that SRM deposits are combined with all users to collectively reach a higher tier and benefit together when trading on the platform. \
\
SRM deposits are counted as collateral and toward the community fee tier.
