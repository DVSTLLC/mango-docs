## **How to create a Sollet.io wallet**

To begin, visit [https://www.sollet.io/](https://www.sollet.io/).  
  
Sollet.io stores private keys in your web browser. You must access the wallet from the same web browser you created it in; otherwise, you’ll be prompted to create a new one. 

The first step in creating a new wallet is recording your seed phrase in a safe place. This phrase is the only way to recover and restore your wallet’s funds in case you forget your password, computer breaks, or sometimes even when you clear browser cookies. This phrase is very important, so please keep it somewhere safe!

After you record your phrase in a safe place and click ‘Continue’, you’ll be prompted to add a password to your wallet. Although this step is optional, it’s highly suggested for security purposes. Enter your desired password and click ‘Create Wallet’.
