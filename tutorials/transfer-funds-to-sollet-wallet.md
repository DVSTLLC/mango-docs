# Transfer funds to sollet wallet

Mango Markets is built on Solana blockchain. To interact on the ecosystem, you’ll need a Solana compatible wallet. A popular wallet and our favorite is Sollet.io. 

Continue reading to learn how create and transfer funds to a Sollet.io wallet.

## **How to create a Sollet.io wallet**

To begin, visit [https://www.sollet.io/](https://www.sollet.io/).  
  
Sollet.io stores private keys in your web browser. You must access the wallet from the same web browser you created it in; otherwise, you’ll be prompted to create a new one. 

The first step in creating a new wallet is recording your seed phrase in a safe place. This phrase is the only way to recover and restore your wallet’s funds in case you forget your password, the computer breaks, or sometimes even when you clear browser cookies. This phrase is very important, so please keep it somewhere safe!

After you record your phrase in a safe place and click ‘Continue’, you’ll be prompted to add a password to your wallet. Although this step is optional, it’s highly suggested for security purposes. Enter your desired password and click ‘Create Wallet’.

Congratulations, you’ve successfully created a Sollet.io wallet! 

## **How to add funds to a Sollet.io wallet**

In the Solana ecosystem, different tokens have separate addresses in the same wallet. This is different from the Ethereum network, for example, where different ERC-20 tokens are received by the same address. 

Transaction fees on the network are paid in SOL. To add new tokens addresses to your wallet or send funds you’ll need some SOL. To add SOL to your wallet, click on SOL asset to expand the menu and then ‘Receive’.

The deposit address displayed is the address to which SOL can be sent to your wallet. Only send SOL to this address, all other tokens \(including SPL tokens like SRM\) will have different deposit addresses.

SOL can be bought on exchanges like [FTX](https://ftx.com/), [Binance](https://www.binance.com/en), [FTX US](https://ftx.us/), and more. Additionally, ETH held on Metamask can be converted to SOL into your Sollet.io. To do this, in the deposit SOL window, click ‘ETH’ and then ‘Connect to Metamask’.

On Solana, tokens that you wish to trade or hold must be explicitly added to your wallet. Once your wallet is funded with SOL, you can add different tokens by clicking the ‘+’ sign in your account menu. Adding new tokens costs a small amount of SOL.

Browse popular tokens or search through manual input with the token mint address.

After you’ve found your desired token, click ‘Add’ and the token will appear in the main account of your wallet. 

To receive funds of added token addresses, click on the asset you wish to deposit and then ‘Receive’ in your main account. 

The deposit address displayed is the address to which your selected asset can be sent to your wallet. Only the selected token type should be sent to this address, other tokens will have different deposit addresses.

Some tokens, like BTC, possess multiple accepted mint types. SPL BTC can be deposited into your wallet using the SPL BTC deposit address while Native BTC is accepted by its own address. Click ‘Native BTC’ in the receive BTC menu to find this deposit address.
