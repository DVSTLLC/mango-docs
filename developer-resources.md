# ðŸ‘· Developer Resources

Mango is completely open source, we see this transparency as vital for the project as it increases the amount of people that understand and can improve the project. The DAO is frequently sponsoring grants for developers to extend, integrate with or try to break the project. Present your idea on the [governance forum](https://forum.mango.markets/c/grants/7) if you would like to receive financial support.



There are a bunch of ways to connect your trading system to mango's on-chain program. The easiest way for traders, used to centralized exchanges, is to use the [REST & Websocket API](https://github.com/microwavedcola1/mango-v3-service) that was purposefully designed to be easy to integrate. In case you want to have the highest level of control, you will most likely want to communicate directly with the blockchain using one of the existing open source wrappers for [typescript](https://github.com/blockworks-foundation/mango-client-v3), [python](https://github.com/blockworks-foundation/mango-explorer) or [.net](https://github.com/bmresearch/Solnet.Mango/).



If you are looking to get an overview about current & running efforts we recommend to join the bi-weekly developer calls on discord (every two weeks on Saturday 4PM UTC). In case you just want to get started on a small project and contribute maybe as part of a hackathon, check out the [Trello](https://trello.com/b/tIj7K3FD/mango-development). The tasks there are proposed by different community members, usually not on the roadmap of any core developer and open for anyone to start.



In case you are a security researcher, we do offer a size-able [bug bounty](mango/bug-bounty.md).
